# Hello-FOSS-ML

Hello There!
This project is a part of HELLO-FOSS: Celebration of Open Source by the Web and Coding Club. We will be focusing on building basic ML models for the MNIST data set. The Repo has been given the label of "Hacktoberfest". Refer to [Hello-FOSS](https://github.com/wncc/Hello-FOSS) for guidelines.

## Guidelines

Absolutely No Prerequisites for contributing to this Project.
We will be using Juniper Notebooks for our Project. If you are an absolute beginner in python have a look at [this](https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/tree/master/Python).

## Tasks on MNSIT Dataset

### Task-1:

- A basic model of Neural Networks has been implemented in TensorFlow [Filename: MNIST_CNN].
- Your task is to improve the accuracy to 97% by changing the number of layers and/or adding convolutions.
- Do not worry if you are an absolute begineer as pseudo code has already been given in the comments.

### Task-2:

- Test data has been loaded and a function to plot this data has also been made [Filename: MNIST_PCA].
- Your task is to perform PCA on this data, for reference look at the examples [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html).
- Now that you have performed PCA, implement this data using a KNN or Logistic Regression or any other algorithm you prefer.

### Task-3:
- Code to get the training and testing data has already been written [Filename: MNIST_FIT].
- Your task is to train this data in the least time and with the best accuracy. Any algorithm can be used to do so, to implement algorithms in tensorflow refer to [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) or [this](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview).
